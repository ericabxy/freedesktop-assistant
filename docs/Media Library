Media Library
=============

Modern desktop environments show basic metadata contained in media files.

A common approach to music library management is to dump all music files in a flat "~/Music" directory and allow a media player frontend to sort everything out via metadata. A major limitation to this is poor metadata management. Certain files may have misnamed title, artist, or album information. The desktop should allow the user to individually correct this information.

Another common approach is to name music files appropriately and orginize them into a folder structure. This approach can coexist with the flat approach.

# Freedesktop Assistant

Integrated, user-friendly technology for graphical desktop environments.

Regular tasks should:

* ✓ Integrate with core desktop applications
* ✓ Require as few clicks and mouse movements as possible
* ✓ Require as few keystrokes as possible, if any at all
* ✗ Not require specialized software suites


### Do not require specialized software suites

- Integrated development environments (IDE)
- Media library applications
- Interfaces with command line

### Concept

Scripts should be cross-platform and extremely simple. Where possible
take only filenames as command-line arguments so the script can
integrate with drag-and-drop interfaces or right-click context menus.

The Nautilus file browser for GNOME reads from a custom script directory
(TODO: note the location of this directory) and will apply any script to
any file via a right-click context menu. The script can even show a
pop-up notification to indicate what it is doing, or success/failure
(TODO: note how to implement this notification).

## Examples

make-application: automatically generate a ".desktop" file for an
executable and save it in "~/.local/share/applications".

goto-applications: open file browser in "~/.local/share/applications" so
user can delete unwanted ".desktop" files.

make-runner: generate a script which invokes an executable as a "runner"
that can run other files.

run-as-script: run the file as if it was an executable script. This
allows users to run a script on systems where the normal available
actions only include opening the file in a text editor.

edit-as-text: open the file as a text file in GEdit or any other text
editor. This gets around the tedious process of shuffling system
defaults around just to edit a script.

edit-with-eureka: open a WAD file with Eureka map editor. This gets
around an issue where opening a WAD file in Eureka using the normal
context menu causes Eureka to become the default runner for WAD files.

extract-with-deutex: extract and convert all the assets from a WAD into
the current directory. Useful for examining the contents of a WAD file.
